banners_a.dds, banners_d.dds, banners_e.dds, banners_f.dds and banners_g.dds are same pattern banners_b.dds and banners_c.dds are very messed pattern which are very different from the banners_a.dds, so we need to handle them directly or you need to adjust your banners file manually to suit the banners_b.dds and banners_c.dds
